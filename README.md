# CDos
A recreation of the MS-DOS platform in C#

# Getting Started
After downloading the executable file or building the application in Visual Studio, you will see a new window, the actual application. This is the command line. For a full list of commands, type 'help' into the command line.

#### A note from the publisher
This program will be entirely coded in Visual C# with the aide of the Console Application API. As of now, this is a small project, so there will not be any updates anytime soon.
